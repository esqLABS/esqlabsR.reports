# Introduction

This document describes the qualification of a published `r params$molecule`
physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model for use with the
Open Systems Pharmacology Software (OSPS) Version 11.2.

The PBPK model has been developed with OSPS version 10 and published by
[@rudesheimPhysiologicallyBasedPharmacokinetic2022]. Model snapshot was
downloaded on 21.07.2023 from the model
[repository](https://github.com/Clinical-Pharmacy-Saarland-University/`r params$molecule`-Model).
As of 21.07.2023, no model version qualified for OSP version 11.2 is
publicly available.


# Methods

## Software

The qualification is performed with OSPS [version
11.2.142](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/PK-Sim/releases/tag/v11.2.142).

## Qualification process

1.  Import project snapshot "`r params$molecule`-model.json" in PK-Sim v11.2.

2.  The snapshot contains 33 simulations. All simulations were exported
to `*.pkml` for simulation in R.

3.  All observed data from the project created with version 11.2 were
exported `*.pkml` for loading in R.

4.  Simulations were simulated in R and the results visually compared to
the results reported in the original publication.

## Data

## Model consolidation

During conversion of projects created with versions before 11, a
separate expression profile is created for each individual. To ensure
that all individuals are using the same expression, expression profiles
of the same protein were compared. All expression profiles for the same
protein were equal. Therefore, the same expression profile was set in
every individual, and the remaining profiles were removed.

# Results

Comparison of time-concentration profiles with observed data are
presented in the following:

```{r}
# list files we want to display
figs <- list.files(file.path('figures', params$molecule), pattern = "\\.[PpJj][PpNn][Gg]", full.names = TRUE)
# Extract the name of the plot from the files names
figs_names <- fs::path_ext_remove(fs::path_file(figs))
```


```{r}
#| fig-cap: !expr figs_names
knitr::include_graphics(figs)
```

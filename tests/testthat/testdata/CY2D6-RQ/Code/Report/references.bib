  abstract = {The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotype is the single most important determinant of CYP2D6 activity as well as interindividual and interpopulation variability in CYP2D6 activity. Here, the CYP2D6 activity score provides an established tool to categorize the large number of CYP2D6 alleles by activity and facilitates the process of genotype-to-phenotype translation. Compared to the broad traditional phenotype categories, the CYP2D6 activity score additionally serves as a superior scale of CYP2D6 activity due to its finer graduation. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have been successfully used to describe and predict the activity score-dependent metabolism of CYP2D6 substrates. This study aimed to describe CYP2D6 drug\textendash gene interactions (DGIs) of important CYP2D6 substrates paroxetine, atomoxetine and risperidone by developing a substrate-independent approach to model their activity score-dependent metabolism. The models were developed in PK-Sim\textregistered, using a total of 57 plasma concentration\textendash time profiles, and showed good performance, especially in DGI scenarios where 10/12, 5/5 and 7/7 of DGI AUClast ratios and 9/12, 5/5 and 7/7 of DGI Cmax ratios were within the prediction success limits. Finally, the models were used to predict their compound's exposure for different CYP2D6 activity scores during steady state. Here, predicted DGI AUCss ratios were 3.4, 13.6 and 2.0 (poor metabolizers; activity score = 0) and 0.2, 0.5 and 0.95 (ultrarapid metabolizers; activity score = 3) for paroxetine, atomoxetine and risperidone active moiety (risperidone + 9-hydroxyrisperidone), respectively.},
